        <h3> Subjects of study</h3>
        <p> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility_as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an nintelligent, dedicated reseacher, and jusgt the kind of person nwe'd like to have on nour team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
          <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#8451 (86 &#8457), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &#215 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 &#215 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
          <li> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> So please can you provide more infomatin on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. </p></ol>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
      </header>
      <header> 
        <div id="dance moves">
          <p> Polynesian chicken dance <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <p>   A little known but <i> very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</ul>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br> <ul>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles as Tweking.</ul>Arctic robot dance <br> <ul> An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this becasue they were really cold. </ul></p>

        <p> Yours sincerely, </p>
